Code which I did for my college club Induction: Task 1: HACKER MODE:

Problem Statement:

Procoder Bharath needs to count the number of registrations for his college fest. He's too busy for something so trivial and so he asks his juniors for help. Help him determine the fastest candidate for the job. Build a website similar to this which would test a user's counting speed. Be creative!

Hacker Mode:

Implement different difficulty modes with different number of layers in the grid and display high scores based on difficulty.
Make the website responsive and mobile friendly using CSS Media Queries.
Pick any colour and vary the shades of the tiles in order of the number on them. For example, 1 would be the lightest and 40 would be the darkest.
Add sound effects to the game
